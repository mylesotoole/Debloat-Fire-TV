### How it works:

- This script utilizes Homebrew and Android Platform Tools for macOS.
- Dependecies will automatically be checked for. If they are not present, this script can install them.
- ADB debugging needs to be turned on your Amazon TV via developer settings.
- Connects to your Fire TV via the ADB feature in Android Platform Tools.
- Commands are sent to your Fire TV to disable Amazon bloatware and optimize performance.
